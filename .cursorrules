Phorus is a bridge that is directly integrated into hyperliquid. 

Brand design: use a dark, deep-green background with soft, organic mint gradients, a premium high-contrast serif for the main headline, and a clean modern sans-serif for UI, creating a calm, high-end “infrastructure-level AI/crypto” feel. The overall style is minimal, spacious, and confident, with a single mint accent color, pill-shaped buttons, and abstract fluid visuals that communicate scale, trust, and next-generation technology.
